# Deep-Learning-Week-Hackathon

Our project is an AI-powered media integrity tool that automates bias detection and fact-checking on X (formerly Twitter). Using Selenium web scraping, it extracts posts and replies, then analyzes them via OpenRouter AI API to identify bias and verify claims. It also validates sources and URLs to ensure credibility, generating structured reports for transparency. By combining automated content extraction, AI-driven verification, and real-time analysis, our solution provides a faster, more reliable approach to combating misinformation and enhancing trust in digital media.
